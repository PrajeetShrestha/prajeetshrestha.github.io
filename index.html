        Hi, I am Prajeet Shrestha. And if you are here you would be surely
        interested in my works. You will indeed find a lot of info about
        different projects and responsibilities that I undertook. But before
        that a little about me!
        <br /><br />
        I have started my career in software development in
        <strong>April of 2014</strong>. I was so happy that I was offered the
        job. I shared the news to my parents and then girlfriend (now my
        life-partner) but they didn't believe me. They thought I was doing some
        kind of prank and I don't blame them, becuase cooincidentally it was
        April 1st :), when I got the confirmation email from my first company.
        <br />
        <br />
        I can't explain how I felt when I got the opportunity for the first
        time. I was literally shivering with joy the first day I was returning
        to my hostel from job. I was so excited for another day. I was grateful
        that I was getting paid to pursue my passion now.
        <br />
        <br />
        I applied for a Junior PHP developer position but got placed as iOS
        developer. And that is the best thing that happened to me, I think in
        terms of my career. Because it helped me discover my passion for mobile
        development and opened a whole new avenue for self-fulfilment and some
        level of financial freedom.

        <br /><br />
        I have considerable experience now in the field. But I still find lot of
        void to fill the gap of knowledge in the field. That's why I am
        curiously and continuously trying to learn best practices of software
        development.
        <br /><br />

        I am very easy going person and get along with the team pretty well. I
        sometimes like to play a guitar on some original numbers that I wrote
        myself. I sketch sometimes. I like to travel and I am a foodie. Lately I
        have picked of some interest in cycling as well. You can find my strava
        profile

        - I enjoy his podcasts and blogs. He has a unique way of disecting
        problems in a unique way. I have learned and implemented some of his
        cool concepts in my projects.

        - I have been using this site during my early career. And they are still
        producing quality content on mobile development.

        <a href="https://www.essentialdeveloper.com/">Essential Developer:</a>
        <br />
        - Caio is my idol :). He has a unique way to explain complex things in
        simple and clear way.

          >Hacking with Swift - Paul Hudson</a
        >
        <br />
        - Whenever we search anything on swift on internet we are bound to find
        Paul's content. His contents are very practical and to the point.
        <br />

        >
        <br />- He talks mostly about backend engineering, but he explains
        software engineering in a cool and understandable way. His content on
        Web RTC and WebSockets is very useful.

                  <div class="project_list_description">
                    This application is a Smart Email client. My responsibility
                    is on optimization of the codebase in this project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One interesting thing that I have been involved in the
                    project is of caching of emails. Emails contents are being
                    fetched from the server as html string. We needed to make
                    emails load faster just like other email client like gmail.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have replaced the proxy server based caching to native
                    platform based caching which had huge impact on processing
                    and storage overhead on the serverside. It helped cut the
                    cost of the company. And with this implementation
                    scalability is lot more flexible in serverside. It also
                    decreased the load time of emails by around 48% by in the
                    appside.
                    <br /><br />
                    I was only involved in iOS development for the project.

                    This is Xamarin based project. This application is a
                    Calendar for Nepal Sambat (or Newari Calendar) it also has
                    conversion feature from, Nepal Sambat to A.D and B.S. This
                    app consumes a proprietary DLL made in Spiralogics which has
                    all the algorithm of calendrical calculations.
                    <br /><br />
                    Note: This app was inaugurated by Hon. Prime Minister of
                    Nepal Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba on Nov 5, 2021.
                    <br />
                    This application have a lot of cultural significance and we
                    got chance to collaborate with local community during the
                    process. It has a potential to be of historical
                    significance, since the algorithm used to calculate dates is
                    very scientific and accurate. Nepal Samvat which was being
                    used since 1143 years in Nepal now has a solid scientific
                    foundation and documentation which previously lacked.<br /><br />
