    <h1>Resume with a personal touch</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Prajeet Shrestha. And this is a showcase of the works that I have been involved in over the years. But before that a little about me!
        <br><br>
            I have started my career in software development in <strong>April of 2014</strong>.
            I was so happy that I was offered the job. 
            I shared the news to my parents and then girlfriend (now my life-partner) but they didn't believe me. 
            They thought I was doing some kind of prank and I don't blame them,
            becuase cooincidentally it was April 1st :), when I got the confirmation email 
            from my first company. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I can't explain how I felt when I got the opportunity for the first time. I was
            literally shivering with joy the first day I was returning to my hostel from job. 
            I was so excited for another day. I was grateful that I was getting paid to pursue my
            passion now.
            <br>
            <br>
            I applied for a Junior PHP developer position but 
            got placed as iOS developer. And that is the best thing that happened to me, 
            I think in terms of my career. 
            Because it helped me discover my passion for mobile development and opened a whole new 
            avenue for self-fulfilment and some level of financial freedom. 

            <br><br>
            I have over 8 years of experience now in the field. But I still find lot of void to fill the 
            gap of knowledge in the field. That's why I am curiously and continuously trying to learn
            best practices of software development.
            <br><br>
            Rest of it is history now :)

                                    This application is a Smart Email client. My responsibility is on optimization of the codebase in this project. 
                                    <br>  <br>
                                    One interesting thing that I have been involved in the project is of caching of emails. Emails contents are being
                                    fetched from the server as html string. We needed to make emails load faster just like other email client like gmail.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I have replaced the proxy server based caching to native platform based caching which had huge impact 
                                    on processing and storage overhead on the serverside. It helped cut the cost of the company.
                                    And with this implementation scalability is lot more flexible in serverside.
                                    It also decreased the load time of emails by around 48% by in the appside.

                                    I was only involved in iOS development for the project.
